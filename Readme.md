# Jmwileydev Samples
This is just a place where I am keeping some samples and things I am working on while
reading and studying.
<p>

[Boyer Moore Search](./BoyerMooreSearch/readme.md)<br>
This directory contains a C++ implementation of the Boyer Moore Search algorithm.

[WPFSamples/ListBoxStylingSample](./ListBoxStylingSample/readme.md)<br>
This directory is simply a sample for listbox styling I created.

[WPFSamples/MaterialDesignColorsToXamlBrushes](./MaterialDesignColorsToXamlBrushes/readme.md)<br>
When I was playing around with Material design and designing my own top-level Window styling I created this app to create XAML
colors and brushes for a MaterialDesign pallette.

[WPFSamples/WpfPlayground](./WpfPlayground/readme.md)<br>
This is a WPF app in which I just test out a bunch of different things. One of the things it does is override the default WindowStyle
and create the title area itself.

[WPFSamples/BezierCurvePlay](./BezierCurvePlay/readme.md)<br>
This sample is barely started and does not contain a ton of code.

[binary_search_tree.h](./include/readme.md)<br>
This directory contains a C++ implementation of a red-black binary search tree. In the directory test_bst there is a
program for testing the tree. It also contains a comparision to the std::set which is also implemented as a red-black
tree. It performs fairly well against that code.
